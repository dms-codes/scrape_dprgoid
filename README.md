## Description

- The script starts by sending an HTTP GET request to the Indonesian Parliament's official member listing page for each province.

- It uses a session for better performance when making multiple requests.

- The `fetch_details` function is used to extract the details of each parliament member from their individual page. It extracts information such as name, email, birthplace, religion, membership number, fraction, electoral district, and various biographical data.

- The script iterates through the pages for each province and scrapes data for all parliament members.

- The collected data is written to a CSV file named 'data_anggota_dpr.csv' with predefined field names.

## Customization

Customize the script by adjusting the following variables:

- `BASE_URL`: The base URL of the Indonesian Parliament's member listing page.
- `TIMEOUT`: The timeout value for HTTP requests.
- `HEADERS`: The user-agent header for HTTP requests.
- The structure of the CSV output, including the field names, can be adjusted in the `fieldnames` list.
